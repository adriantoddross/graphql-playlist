# Learning GraphQL from NetNinja
In anticipation of my upcoming internship with [Axio](https://axio.com/careers/?gh_jid=4020412002) in Spring 2020, I've started learning GraphQL to minimize the ramp-up time I'll need when I start working there.

## Why do you want to work at Axio?
I had a brief meeting with their [VP of Technology](), got to meet the team and see what their work environment was like, and would really love the opportunity to start my career there as a junior developer. They've hired devs from bootcamps in the past and the role was recommended to me by a former intern.
